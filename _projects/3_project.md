## 📝 Django To-Do List Application

This project is a **backend-focused To-Do List web application** built using **Django**.  
It was developed as part of my learning journey into backend engineering, with a strong emphasis on understanding **core web application concepts** and gradually introducing **DevOps practices**.

The application focuses on simplicity while reinforcing essential ideas such as request handling, data persistence, CRUD operations, and deployment workflows.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Strengthen backend fundamentals using Django
- Understand relational data modeling with PostgreSQL
- Implement full CRUD functionality
- Practice containerization and deployment workflows
- Lay groundwork for CI/CD and infrastructure automation

---

## ⚙️ Core Features

- ➕ Add, edit, and delete tasks  
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed  
- 📋 View active and completed tasks  
- 🧪 Basic form validation and error handling  

---

## 🧠 Technical Overview

- **Backend Framework:** Django (Python)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Frontend:** HTML & CSS (Django Templates)  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

The application follows Django’s standard **MTV (Model-Template-View)** architecture, ensuring clear separation of concerns and maintainable code structure.
